I joined Rent the Runway as a manager without a team, a director of engineering in name and something closer to a tech lead in practice.

This book is structured to follow the stages of a typical career path for an engineer who ends up becoming a manager. From the first steps as a mentor to the challenges of senior leadership,

Managers who care about you as a person, and who actively work to help you grow in your career. Managers who teach you important skills and give you valuable feedback. Managers who help you navigate difficult situations, who help you figure out what you need to learn. Managers who want you to take their job someday.

One-on-one meetings (1-1s) with your direct manager are an essential feature of a good working relationship.

For most people, good 1-1s are not status meetings.

I encourage you to share the responsibility of having good 1-1s with your manager. Come with an agenda of things you would like to discuss. Prepare for the time yourself.

The second thing to expect from your manager is feedback. I’m not just talking about performance reviews, although that is part of

The sooner you know about your bad habits, the easier they are to correct. This also goes for getting praise. A great manager will notice some of the little things you’re doing well in your day-to-day, and recognize you for them.

the feedback you get from your manager will be somewhat public if it’s praise, and private if it’s criticism.

If you’re unhappy with a teammate, your manager may not do anything unless you bring the issue to her attention.

It’s great when managers can identify and assign stretch projects that will help us grow and learn new things. Beyond assigning stretch projects, though, good managers will also help you understand the value of the work you’re doing even when it is not fun or glamorous.

your manager holds some responsibility for helping you find training and other resources for career growth. This may be helping you find a conference to attend or a class to take, helping you get a book you need, or pointing you to an expert somewhere else in the company who can help you learn something.

great CTOs have strong communication skills, project management skills, and product sense, in addition to good technical sense.

Knowing yourself is step one. Step two is going after what you want.

If you want to go home, figure out how to get your work done and go home. Sometimes you will have to go against the cultural grain to set your own boundaries, and that will feel uncomfortable. On the flip side, sometimes if you want a bigger job, you will have to work more hours to get it. You will not get everything you ask for, and asking is not usually a fun or comfortable experience. However, it’s the fastest way forward.

She’ll be imperfect. She will say dumb things, or do things that feel unfair or harmful to you. She’ll give you work that you don’t want to do, and get annoyed when you complain about doing it. Her job is to do the best thing for the company and the team.

She is using a technique designed by psychologist Gary Klein known as a premortem. In a postmortem, doctors convene to examine the causes of a patient’s unexpected death so they can learn and improve for the next time a similar circumstance arises. Outside of the medical world, we call this a number of things—a debriefing, an exit interview, a wrap-up meeting, a review—but whatever it’s called, the idea is the same: We’re examining the project in hindsight, after it happened. A premortem is different. In it, we look to envision what could go wrong, what will go wrong, in advance, before we start.

See things for what they are. Do what we can. Endure and bear what we must. What blocked the path now is a path. What once impeded action advances action. The Obstacle is the Way.

The first act of people management for many engineers is often unofficial. They find themselves, through the luck of the draw, mentoring someone.

Many organizations use mentors as part of their onboarding process for all new hires.

Get him started installing the IDE and checking out the code. Touch base several times a day to make sure he’s not feeling lost or overwhelmed by the volume of new information.

Is this project broken down into milestones? If not, spend a little time in the first few days of the intern’s tenure breaking it down. Walk through the breakdown with your intern.

One of the early lessons in leadership, whether it is via direct management or indirect influence, is that people are not good at saying precisely what they mean in a way that others can exactly understand.

communicating what needs to happen. If you expect him to do research on his own before asking you a question, tell him

communicating what needs to happen. If you expect him to do research on his own before asking you a question, tell him so! Ask him to explain a piece of code to you, or some product or process, and point him to the documents that you believe explain it.

Mentoring new hires is critical. Your job as a new hire mentor consists of onboarding, helping this person adjust to life in the company effectively, and building your and her network of contacts in the company.

Effective teams have good onboarding documents they provide to new hires.

it’s very difficult to build a career at any company with multiple teams without building a strong network of trusted people to share information and ideas with.

Tell your mentee what you expect from him.

The alpha geek tries to create a culture of excellence, but ends up creating a culture of fear.

The alpha geek is usually an excellent, effective engineer who goes into management either because she was pushed into it or because she believes that the smartest person on the team should be the manager.

Highly technical hands-on managers can be good for small teams of senior engineers, but alpha geeks are often better off kept out of management and given more of a focus on technical strategy and system design.

Developing patience and empathy is an important part of the career path of anyone working in a team-based environment. Brilliant, introverted developers may not ever want to formally manage, but encouraging them to mentor 1-1 helps them develop stronger external perspectives, not to mention their own networks.

Mentoring provides a great opportunity to cultivate curiosity and see the world through fresh eyes.

Mentoring provides a great opportunity to cultivate curiosity and see the world through fresh eyes. When faced with a mentee’s questions, you can start to observe what about your organization is not so obvious to a new person.

Does your company have an internship program? If so, can you volunteer to mentor an intern?

How does your company think about onboarding? Do you assign mentors to new hires? If not, can you propose to your manager that you try doing this, and volunteer to mentor someone? Have you ever had a great mentor?

I was a good communicator. I could write clear documents, I could give presentations without melting down, and I could talk to people in different teams and different roles and explain what was going on. I was also good at prioritizing. I was eager to push work forward and decide what needed to be done next. Finally, I was willing to pick up the pieces and do what needed to be done to make progress. I think, in the end, this pragmatic urgency was the deciding factor. The tech lead role, after all, is a leadership position, even when it’s not a management position.

the title that it is expected to be both a technical position and a leadership role, and that it is often a temporary set of responsibilities rather than a permanent title. So, with all that said: what is a tech lead?

The tech lead role is not a point on the ladder, but a set of responsibilities that any engineer may take on once they reach the senior level. This role may or may not include people management, but if it does, the tech lead is expected to manage these team members to the high management standards of RTR tech. These standards include: Regular (weekly) 1-1 touchbases Regular feedback on career growth, progression towards goals, areas for improvement, and praise as warranted Working with reports to identify areas for learning and helping them grow in these areas via project work, external learning, or additional mentoring

As the tech lead I am leading a team, but we all report to the same engineering manager. So not only do I have to influence my peers, but I also have to influence up to my manager

Project planners break work down into rough deliverables. With this hat on, you’re learning to find efficient ways of breaking down the work so that the team can work quickly.

Here are some guidelines: Break down the work. Get out a spreadsheet, or a Gantt chart, or whatever works for you, and start breaking down your big deliverable

Start with the biggest pieces, then break the big pieces down into smaller pieces,

Push through the details and the unknowns. The trick of project management is not to stop when you feel a little bit stuck, or tired of it. It is tiring and tedious, as I said earlier. And it’s not something you probably know how to do well.

Run the project and adjust the plan as you go. The value of a good planning process is that it helps you know approximately how far the project has come,

Use the insights gained in the planning process to manage requirements changes. You learned a lot by breaking down the project given the original set of requirements.

Revisit the details as you get close to completion. Toward the end of the project, the tedium returns. It is time to really attend to the finishing details.

Decision Point: Stay on the Technical Track or Become a Manager

and give talks, and this is encouraged because it will help your team hire and improve your standing in the tech industry. In short,

short, you get to make decisions, you create the culture, and your effectiveness is evident to all around you, making your path to promotion quick and your career exciting

When you only had a small team you were able to balance things and still write code, but as your team has grown you’ve lost touch with the code.

How to Be a Great Tech Lead Great tech leads have a number of characteristics, but these are the most important. Understand the Architecture

Be a Team Player If you’re doing all of the interesting work yourself, stop. Look at the tricky, boring, or annoying areas of technical need and see if you can unstick those areas. Working on the less exciting parts of the code base can teach you a lot about where the process is broken.

You’re a senior engineer who has a lot of talent as a developer, and it’s reasonable for you to take on some of the harder tasks.

Lead Technical Decisions You’ll be involved in most major technical decisions for your team.

Communicate Your productivity is now less important than the productivity of the whole team.

Write design documents and get feedback on them from better writers. Write blog posts for your tech blog or your personal blog. Speak in team meetings, speak at meetups, and get practice standing up in front of an audience.

Give others a chance to speak, and hear what they say. Practice repeating things back to people to ensure you understand them.

One strategy is to ask a series of questions that are intended to help you get to know the aspects of the person that impact your ability to manage him well. These questions might include: How do you like to be praised, in public or in private? Some people really hate to be praised in public. You want to know this. What is your preferred method of communication for serious feedback? Do you prefer to get such feedback in writing so you have time to digest it, or are you comfortable with less formal verbal feedback? Why did you decide to work here? What are you excited about? How do I know when you’re in a bad mood or annoyed? Are there things that always put you in a bad mood that I should be aware of? Maybe a direct report fasts for religious reasons, which sometimes makes him cranky. Maybe he always gets stressed out while on-call. Maybe he hates reviews season. Are there any manager behaviors that you know you hate? If you asked me this question, my answer would be: skipping or rescheduling 1-1s, neglecting to give me feedback, and avoiding difficult conversations. Do you have any clear career goals that I should know about so I can help you achieve them? Any surprises since you’ve joined, good or bad, that I should know about? Things like: Where are my stock options? You promised me a relocation bonus and I haven’t gotten it yet. Why are we using SVN and not Git? I didn’t expect to be so productive already!

create a 30/60/90-day plan. This can include basic goals,

Mondays and Fridays are bad days for 1-1s because people tend to sometimes take long weekends and miss these days. I prefer to do 1-1s in the morning before things get busy, in order to avoid having the schedule slip or being forced to reschedule due to other things coming up.

“don’t waste time with pointless meetings” mandate and ensures that things will happen.

My goal in a 1-1 is first to listen to anything my direct reports want to discuss. I want the meeting to be driven by them, and I want to give them space to bring up whatever they feel is important. I view a 1-1 session as much as a creative discussion as a planning meeting.

The Progress Report When you get to the stage where you’re managing managers, a lot of your 1-1 meetings will be diving into details of projects they’re overseeing that you don’t have time to dig into on your own.

Good Manager, Bad Manager: Micromanager, Delegator

Adjust Your Focus Depending on the Stage of Projects

Establish Standards for Code and Systems

Treat the Open Sharing of Information, Good or Bad, in a Neutral to Positive

Creating a Culture of Continuous Feedback

There are some steps you can take to be great at giving continuous feedback: Know your people. The first required part of successfully giving continuous feedback is a basic understanding of the individuals on your team.

Observe your people. You can’t give feedback if you aren’t paying attention.

Performance reviews reward the time spent by providing a valuable chance to synthesize a bunch of information about a person. Beyond that, 360 reviews give you at least a high-level view into what other people are thinking about your direct reports.

Spend plenty of time on accomplishments and strengths You want to celebrate achievements, talk about what’s going well, and give plenty of praise for good work.

There are people who: Struggle with saying no to distractions and end up helping with other projects instead of finishing their own Do good work but are hard for others to work with, tending to be overly critical or rude in meetings, code reviews, or other collaborative activities Struggle to break their work up into intermediate deliverables, and don’t balance planning and design with getting things done Work well with other engineers but do not work well with other departments or teams Struggle to follow the accepted best practices of the team, cut corners, or otherwise do sloppy work

If you’re a manager, you are going to play a key role in getting people on your team promoted.

Many companies expect you to be acting at the next level before you get promoted to it. This practice exists to prevent the “Peter Principle,” in which people are promoted to their level of incompetence.

Challenging Situations: Firing Underperformers One of the hardest things that any manager must do is to fire someone for underperformance. This is difficult to write about because so much of the act of firing employees is dictated by HR departments these days, even at small companies.

You’ll always need to have a record of negative feedback to fire someone in any environment where HR is active and a standard performance improvement plan is required. If you have no HR, I suggest that you still give people clear improvement feedback in writing,

Chapter 5. Managing a Team It’s a short step from managing a person or two to managing a whole team, but managing a team

“engineering lead”: The engineering lead will spend less time writing code, but they still engage in small technical deliverables, such as bug fixes and small features, without blocking or slowing down the progress of their team.

The engineering lead is an independent manager. They are comfortable managing team members with different skill sets from their own. They communicate expectations clearly to all team members, and solicit and deliver individual feedback frequently (not just in the scope of review periods).

However, at this level, if you don’t stay in the code, you risk making yourself technically obsolete too early in your career. You may be on a management career path, but that doesn’t mean that you should wash your hands of technical responsibilities.

As you learned in your time as a tech lead, a critical part of complex project management is understanding the pieces of the system well enough to determine the best path to implementation. The more you understand the code in the system, the easier determining this path will be.

Unhappiness Due to Overwork This problem is much easier to solve. Usually, unhappiness due to overwork has a root in problems that you can address. For example, if overwork is due to (in)stability of the production systems, it’s your job as the manager to slow down the product roadmap in order to focus on stability for a while.

Many pieces of management advice tell new managers that part of their job, if they are effective, is to be a shield (or, less politely, a “bullshit umbrella”). They should help their team focus on what they need to get done without being distracted by the wider drama, politics, and changes happening in the company around them.

Strong leadership cares about cultivating success and having a team that delivers successful projects,

Run Retrospectives for the Processes and Day-to-Day Agile processes usually have a retrospective meeting at the end of each two-week development sprint,

The Dos and Don’ts of Managing Conflict Don’t rely exclusively on consensus or voting. Consensus can appear morally authoritative, but that assumes that everyone involved in the voting process is impartial, has an equal stake in the various outcomes, and has equal knowledge of the context.

Do set up clear processes to depersonalize decisions. When you want to allow for group decision making,

Do set up clear processes to depersonalize decisions. When you want to allow for group decision making, the group needs to have a clear set of standards that they use to evaluate decisions.

Don’t turn a blind eye to simmering issues. Another way that conflict avoidance manifests is an inability to address problems until they’ve gone on for way too long.

Don’t take it out on other teams. Ironically, conflict-avoidant managers often seek conflict when it comes to other teams.

Do remember to be kind. It’s natural and perfectly human to want to be liked by other people. Many of us believe that the way to be liked is to be seen as nice — that niceness is itself the goal. Your goal as a manager, however, should not be to be nice, it should be to be kind.

Don’t be afraid. Conflict avoidance often arises from fear. We’re scared of the responsibility of making the decision. We’re afraid of seeming too demanding. We’re afraid people will quit if we give them uncomfortable feedback.

Do get curious. Thinking about your actions is the best way to combat fear of conflict.

One variant of the toxic employee is the brilliant jerk, who, as we discussed earlier, produces individually outsized results, but is so ego-driven that she creates a mixture of fear and dislike in almost everyone around her.

Another very common problem team member is the noncommunicator — the person who hides information from you, from his teammates, from his product manager.

the person who simply doesn’t respect you as a manager, or who doesn’t respect her teammates. Addressing this person will be difficult and you may require some help from your manager, but if you can handle this yourself, it’s a sign of great character.

You have 10 productive engineering weeks per engineer per quarter There are 52 weeks in a year, or about 13 per quarter. However, realistically your team will lose a lot of that time. Vacations, meetings, review season, production outages, onboarding new employees — all of these things take away from focus. Don’t expect to get more than 10 weeks’ worth of focused effort on the main projects per team member per quarter.

Budget 20% of time for generic sustaining engineering work across the board By “generic sustaining engineering work,” I mean testing, debugging, cleaning up legacy code, migrating language or platform

As you approach deadlines, it is your job to say no You will almost certainly have occasional deadlines, either goal dates that you’ve set or goal dates that came down from on high. The only way to achieve these goals is to cut scope at the end of the project.

the doubling rule for quick estimates, but push for planning time to estimate longer tasks The popular doubling rule of software estimation is, “Whenever asked for an estimate, take your guess and double it.” This rule is appropriate and good to use when you’re asked for an off-the-cuff guess.

Managing Multiple Teams Welcome to the world of multiple-team management! We’re going to talk about managing multiple teams before we talk about managing managers, because while those things are related, they don’t necessarily coincide.

They are obsessed with creating high-functioning, engaged, and motivated organizations, and they are expected to own retention goals within their organization. Additionally, engineering directors are responsible for strategically balancing immediate and long-term product-/business-focused work with technical debt and strategic technical development.

Due to their breadth of exposure to both technology and the business drivers, directors are responsible for guiding the goal-setting process for all of the teams in their organization, helping these teams articulate goals that support both business initiatives and technology and organizational quality.

write blog posts for your engineering blog, prepare conference talks, or participate in an open source project. Do something to scratch that creative itch, which can otherwise be hard for you to scratch as a manager.

Managing your time comes down to one important thing: understanding the difference between importance and urgency. Pretty much all of your tasks will fall on a graph of these two elements. Roughly, they are in one of four quadrants (see Table 6-1). Table 6-1. Prioritizing your time Not urgent Urgent Important Strategic: make time Obvious work Unimportant Obvious avoid Tempting distractions

called this section “Decisions and Delegation” — so where does delegation fit in? Delegation is the primary way you claw yourself out of the feeling of having too many plates spinning at once. As tasks come at you, ask yourself: do I need to be the person who completes this work? The answer may depend on a few factors (see Table 6-2). Table 6-2. Deciding when to delegate or do it yourself Frequent Infrequent Simple Delegate Do it yourself Complex Delegate (carefully) Delegate for training purposes The degree of complexity and the frequency of the task can act as guides to determining whether

“Yes, and” Saying no to your boss rarely looks like a simple “no” when you’re a manager. Instead, it looks like the “yes, and” technique of improvisational comedy. “Yes, we can do that project, and all we will need to do is delay the start of this other project that is currently on the roadmap.”

That policy consists of the hard requirements that must be met in order to say yes, and some guidelines for thinking about the decision. Making a policy helps your team know in advance the cost of getting to “yes.”

The next strategy, “help me say yes,” is similar to policy writing, but works better for the one-off instances where there is no clear policy.

Don’t Prevaricate When you know that you need to say no, it’s better to say it quickly than to delay and drag out the process.

Measuring the Health of Your Development Team When you’re focusing on the health of your development teams, put on your technical hat to design systems and processes that will keep things moving.

If your company doesn’t appreciate the value of releasing code frequently, I’m sorry. In this modern era, frequency of code change is one of the leading indicators of a healthy engineering team.

responsible for keeping your team happy and productive, and often the solution to this is not cheerleading or paying them better or praising them more, but instead enabling them to be more productive, challenging them to go faster and do better work,

If you’re building a brand new product for a small but growing business, it may be more important to focus on features over stability.

Incident management, when it becomes merely reacting to incidents rather than working to reduce them, can turn into a task that diminishes your team’s ability to do what they do best.

We engineers automate so that we can focus on the fun stuff — and the fun stuff is the work that uses most of your brain, and it’s not usually something you can do for hours and hours, day after day. So be impatient to figure out the nut of what’s important.

Chapter 7. Managing Managers The job expectations for managing managers are not that different from the expectations of managing multiple teams.

You may manage functions in your division that you haven’t managed before and that you don’t have a lot of expertise in — for example, a software engineering manager who now also manages the operations teams for a division. While managing multiple teams can be exhausting and daunting, managing managers adds a whole new level of complexity that is often a surprise.

Things are now obscured through an additional level of abstraction, and it’s easy to miss out on details because you no longer engage regularly with all of the individual developers on each team.

What is a skip-level meeting? Put briefly, it is a meeting with people who report to people who report to you. There are a few different ways that people hold these meetings, but their purpose is to help you get perspective on the health and focus of your teams.

One form of skip-level meeting is a short 1-1 meeting, held perhaps once a quarter, between the head of an organization and each person in that organization.

Some suggested prompts to provide the person you are holding the skip-level 1-1 with include: What do you like best/worst about the project you are working on? Who on your team has been doing really well recently? Do you have any feedback about your manager — what’s going well, what isn’t? What changes do you think we could make to the product? Are there any opportunities you think we might be missing? How do you think the organization is doing overall? Anything we could be doing better/more/less? Are there any areas of the business strategy you don’t understand? What’s keeping you from doing your best work right now? How happy (or not) are you working at the company? What could we do to make working at the company more fun? The 1-1 doesn’t scale forever. If a quarter has, say, 60 working days, and you have 60 people in your organization, doing one a quarter with each member means you have one every day, or five a week for 12 weeks.

However, if you have a smaller organization, dedicating time every quarter to each person does have some benefits.

Use skip-level meetings to help you detect areas where you need to support your new manager fully, and let her know that you’ll be holding skip-levels frequently as you help to guide her most effectively.

One common sign of a struggling first-time manager is overwork. A new manager who is working all the time is probably failing to hand off her old responsibilities to other people on her team, and so she’s attempting to do two jobs at once.

First, make sure that the person has the skills you need. Second, make sure that she’s a culture match for your organization. The biggest difference between a management interview and an engineering interview is that managers can, theoretically, bullshit you more easily.

This book is for the engineer who wrote code for a while and eventually moved into management, and successfully grew a career up along that path.

CTO is not an engineering role. CTO is not the top of the technical ladder, and it is not the natural progression engineers should strive to achieve over the course of their careers. It’s not a role most people who love coding, architecture, and deep technical design would enjoy doing. It follows that the CTO is not necessarily the best engineer in the company. Now, with that out of the way: what is a CTO, if not the best writer of code and the natural pinnacle of the engineering ladder? The challenge in defining the role of the CTO is that if you look at the folks who hold that title, you’ll see many different manifestations.

If you give up management, you’re giving up the most important power you ever had over the business strategy, and you effectively have nothing but your organizational goodwill and your own two hands.

Challenging Situations: Delivering Bad News We all have times when we have to deliver bad news to our teams. Maybe the company is having layoffs.

Don’t blast an impersonal message to a large group. The worst way to communicate bad news is via impersonal mediums like email and chat, especially mediums with commenting abilities.

Do talk to individuals as much as possible. Instead of impersonal or group-based communication, try your best to talk to people individually about the news.

Don’t force yourself to deliver a message you can’t stand behind. You may have a hard time delivering this news because you don’t like it yourself.

Some things that are generally considered “bad” can be OK under certain circumstances. These include: Having a single point of failure Having known bugs and issues Being unable to tolerate high load Losing data Putting out code that is undertested Having slow performance There are situations and companies in which all of those risks are acceptable to take. That being said, True North helps us understand that all these issues must be carefully considered when we put code into production.

As the team grows and evolves, it’s important to attend to your culture as you would attend to any other important piece of infrastructure that you rely on.

You have a problem? Figure out a solution and fix it. That solution doesn’t work? Try something else. You don’t need to find the perfect solution; you need to find something that will get you through to the next milestone, whether that milestone is the next release, the next growth spurt, the next funding round, or the next hire.

Culture is how things get done, without people having to think about it. Frederick Laloux, Reinventing Organizations: A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness

For example, the most senior individual contributors worked on the technical and skills expectations for the individual contributor levels.

Look for examples. Second, I got more examples of ladders from friends at other companies to help provide some ideas for the details.

Be detailed. One of the biggest challenges you’ll face when writing a good ladder is sketching out the details.

Writing a Career Ladder Here are some important issues to consider when writing a career ladder for your organization: Solicit participation from your team.

Use both long-form descriptions and summaries. I broke the ladder out into two documents. The first was a shorthand spreadsheet version that allowed me to see the various level attributes side-by-side and see how they evolved through increasing levels.

Consider how the ladder relates to salary. Your HR department will want to use the career ladder to help set salary expectations.

Use narrow salary bands for early-career stages. Lots of levels and narrow salary bands mean that you can promote people quickly and justify giving them raises while keeping your pay for all people at a certain level close to the same.

Use wide salary bands when and where you have fewer levels. Wide salary bands and few levels make a clearer distinction between the skills at each level, and should make it easier to tell who is operating at which level.

Consider your breakpoint levels. It is common for companies to have certain levels that they consider “up or out.” These are early-career roles where a lack of advancement means that the person has not achieved the maturity or independence needed to remain at the company.

Recognize achievement. Some companies want to keep levels secret, but that tends to be impossible. People will talk.

Split management and technical tracks. It’s pretty obvious in this day and age that you need separate tracks for management and individual contribution.

Senior management is generally a volume-driven need. You need enough managers to manage the people you have on the team. Senior technical depends on the complexity and scope of technical leadership that your teams and products require.

Consider making people management skills a mid-career requirement. Encourage everyone to have some sort of management or mentorship experience before they are eligible to be promoted above the level of the track split.

Years of experience. No one likes to put artificial barriers onto people, and years of experience can feel like the most artificial barrier.

Cross-Functional Teams Who do you work with? Who do you report to? Who do you collaborate with? The answers are obvious in both extremely small companies (answer: everyone) and very large companies (answer: there’s a pretty clear structure that was set up before you joined). As a leader at a growing company, you’ll need to help answer these questions for your team and your company at least once, and probably multiple times. What should the answers be? I want to take some time to talk about one of the best things I experienced in my work at Rent the Runway: the evolution of our product engineering organization. When I joined, the engineering team was divided into roughly

Conway’s Law is often cited in discussions of this kind of structure. It states: “Organizations which design systems…are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.”

Structuring Cross-Functional Teams How do the nuts and bolts of such “pod” structures work? One element that often causes anxiety is who is managing whom. When we moved to this team organization, we did not change the management structures. Engineers were managed by engineering managers and reported in to me. Product managers reported to the head of product.

pods still need some time to account for engineering-specific tasks like on-call, interviewing, and sustaining engineering (aka technical debt). I advise reserving 20% of all engineering time for such work, based purely on my personal experience and the experience of my peers in engineering management.

Practical Advice: Depersonalize Decision Making There are three major processes that you should consider adding as your team grows.

Code Review Code review is, for better or worse, a modern standard. Once you have a team of a certain size with a certain number of people working on a code base, code review can be a valuable tool for ensuring the stability and long-term quality of that code base.

Be clear about code review expectations. For the most part, code reviews don’t catch bugs; tests catch bugs. The exceptions to this rule are that code review can catch missing updates to comments or documentation or missing changes to related features,

Use a linter for style issues. Engineers can waste absurd amounts of time on questions of style, specifically formatting. This should not be up for debate in code review. Decide on a style, and put that style into a linter that formats the code automatically.

Keep an eye on the review backlog. Some companies implement a limit on how many outstanding review requests a person can have assigned to him, and they block that person from requesting review when he has too many outstanding requests.

The Outage Postmortem I’m not going to talk about the details of incident management, but the “postmortem” process is a critical element of good engineering. In fact, instead of calling the process a postmortem, many have started calling it a “learning review” to indicate that its purpose is not determining cause of death but learning from the incident.

Resist the urge to point fingers and blame. It is incredibly tempting, after a stressful outage, to point fingers and ask people why they failed to foresee the consequences of their behavior.

Look at the circumstances around the incident and understand the context of the events.

Be realistic about which takeaways are important and which are worth dropping. Be careful not to give the impression that people need to solve every problem they identify in the course of the exercise.
